# Cocolevio-Interview-Challenge

A solution for a problem that resembles the knapsack problem. Assuming the company that wishes to use this solution does not have to fully fill a request for material, this problem becomes the fractional knapsack problem. First, all of the provided company information is put into custom objects that hold the name of an individual company, amount requested, the ratio of price/amount, and the profit made from selling to this particular company. Next, all of the company info is put into a list and sorted by the ratio of price/amount in descending order. Finally, we pick companies at the top of the sorted list and sell as much of the requested material as we can while keeping track of which companies were sold to and the associated profit. This info is also printed to the command line as a list of the companies we decided to sell to followed by the total profit generated.
